			<p class="sub-heading pl-32px pr-32px pl-md-0 pr-md-0 mb-24px mb-sm-56px text-20">Negative Consequences If You Do Not Address Back Taxes.

						<p>The IRS and states can garnish your wages so that you receive less than usual in terms of your paycheck at work. They can also issue 1099 levies for contractors who have clients that owe them money. With no action, the IRS and many states will continue to garnish wages until either the tax liabilities (plus penalties and interest) are paid off or the time clock for collecting the debt expires (generally with the IRS it is ten years). Fortunately, a trusted tax firm can remove or reduce wage garnishment in most cases.</p>

						<p>	<b>Wage Garnishment:</b> The IRS and states can garnish yo ur wages so that you receive less than usual in terms of your paycheck at work.

With no action, the IRS and many states will continue to garnish wages until either the ta x liabilities (plus penalties and interest) are paid off or the time clock for collecting the debt expires (generally with the IRS it is ten years). Fortunately, a trusted tax firm can remove or reduce wage garnishment in most cases.</p>

						3) Can You Settle for Less Than You Owe? Is Tax Forgiveness Real?
					</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<p>Settling taxes for less is possible, but it is not an option for everyone. Being able to settle for less is determined mainly by the taxpayer's ability to pay, future ability to pay, the situation that caused the liability, errors made by the taxpayer or possible mistakes made by the taxation authorities. Below are some methods that may be used to settle for less.</p>
						<p>	<b>Offer in Compromise:</b> This method allows taxpayers to settle for far less than the total amount owed if they meet the strict guidelines and complete the paperwork 100% correctly.</p>
						<p>	<b>Partial Payment Installment Agreement:</b> Allows the taxpayer to make small monthly payments towards the debt. The IRS may forgive tax liabilities if it is not all paid back before the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED).</p>
						<p>	<b>Uncollectible/Hardship:</b> The taxing authorities can stop collection actions until the taxpayer's financial situation improves. The debt may be forgiven if their financial situation doesn't improve before the statute expires.</p>
						<p>	<b>Penalty Abatement:</b> If the taxpayer has an acceptable reason for not staying in compliance with tax laws, there is a possibility that the IRS and some states may waive penalties that accrued.</p>
						<p>	<b>Amending tax returns:</b> Many situations come up where the taxpayer may have made errors with prior filings, or taxation authorities filed on their behalf (SFR) which caused them to owe more taxes than if the taxpayer had filed their tax return. In these situations, an amended tax return can lower outstanding tax liabilities if accepted.</p>
						<p>Beware of tax companies that promise they can settle taxes for less because there is no way of them knowing for sure before knowing your total tax and financial situation.</p>

					6) IRS Federal Tax Lien – What Does It Mean and What Do I Do?</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<h2>
							What Is a Tax Lien?
						</h2>
						<p>A Tax Lien is the first major step the IRS takes against individuals in order to collect back taxes. A Tax Lien gives the IRS a legal claim to your property as security or payment for your tax debt. It is used in order to protect the government’s interest in your assets.</p>
						<h2>
							When and Why is a Tax Lien Filed?
						</h2>
						<p>If you have unpaid back taxes and have not cooperated with the demands of the IRS to make the payments of the tax amount owed, it is likely that eventually you will receive a tax lien, which will then lead to a tax levy. Recently, the IRS will raise the debt threshold for issuing tax liens in most cases from $5,000 to $10,000 (policy change announced in 2011) largely due to the fact that tax liens can hurt taxpayers further and lessen their likelihood of getting into compliance with the IRS.</p>
						<p>Here is how the process works. The IRS will first send you a letter with an assessment of your tax liability. This letter will typically state the amount that is unpaid as well as late payment penalty and interest. If the assessment letter is ignored, the IRS will follow up with four more letters, CP-501, CP-CP-503, CP-504, and finally LT11/L1058 in most cases. These letters will get more and more threatening as the numbers get higher. The final one of the CP letters mentions it’s intent to levy. After these letters are sent to the taxpayer and there is no response or the tax amount is not paid, the IRS determines that they are not able to collect the tax the conventional way, so the IRS will then file a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) and potentially move forward with a levy. Once you receive this tax lien, the lien has already been attached to your property. The purpose of the tax lien is to prevent you from selling or borrowing against any of the major assets that you own. With a tax lien in place, it gives legal claim to the IRS over that piece of property that the lien was placed and removes your rights to the property. Moreover, tax liens are public records.</p>
						<h2>
							Effects of a Tax Lien
						</h2>
						<p>A tax lien makes it very difficult to get any credit to make additional large purchases, such as a boat, car, or house. Having a lien placed on you by the IRS can be financially crippling for the time it is in place, it pretty much means you can’t hold any assets in your name and you have to rely on other people for financing (as lien is on your credit too). All creditors would be notified including your mortgage company. A tax lien will stay in place as long as the IRS can legally enforce action against you (typically 10 years statute of limitations), or until your tax liabilities have been paid or settled with the IRS. The IRS becomes the highest priority creditor, so if you sold your house, car, or whatever property the lien was one and you had other liens on that property, the IRS would be the first to be paid.
							<br/>If you do nothing about the tax lien, the IRS will eventually begin to seize your assets and sell them at a public or private sale. Once the IRS actually starts seizing your assets to satisfy the back tax liability, this is known as a tax levy. A tax levy is the most lethal weapon that the IRS possesses for collecting taxes.
							<br/>One thing to note, is even when a tax lien is “released,” and your public records are updated as showing the tax lien was released, the history or the fact that you received a tax lien the first place may still hinder your ability to borrow, get a job, rent a house and so forth. The IRS in February of 2011 announced policy changes, whereby in most cases tax lien can be withdrawn or expunged from public records if the taxpayer sets up a direct debit installment agreement (DDIA), has one already setup (they can just request to have lien withdrawn), and owes $25,000 or less. Of course, exceptions do happen.

							How to Release a Tax Lien
						</h2>
						<p>Request a Free Tax Analysis & Consult Get Started An IRS tax lien will remain in place until you pay off taxes owed, prove financial hardship, or until the IRS has levied enough of your assets to call it even. With just a tax lien, the IRS cannot take assets, but they will eventually place a levy on your assets if no action is taken when a tax lien is given. A tax levy is highly likely if you do not resolve your taxes after the lien is placed. A lien ensures that the IRS has a legal claim on your property so you cannot sell or dispose of property without the IRS taking its share first.
							<br/>Recently in February of 2011, the IRS announced policy changes whereby they would increase the threshold for when a tax lien is issued. Moreover, they will even withdraw tax liens in most casts if you owe less than $25k and setup an IRS Installment Agreement with a direct debit monthly payment.
						</p>
						<h2>
							What to Do if the IRS Files a Tax Lien in Error
						</h2>
						<p>The IRS occasionally files a tax lien notice when you don’t owe anything. Perhaps you paid your bill late, and the IRS neglected to update your account. If this happens, under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights you are entitled to a “Certificate of Release.” The “Certificate of Release” will state that the lien was filed in error. It will then be your job to mail or deliver photocopies of the release to the three credit bureaus- Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. This will minimize the damage to your credit rating caused by the IRS error.
						</p>
						<h2>
							Notice of Federal Tax Lien: What This Letter Means & What to Do
						</h2>
						<p>If the IRS has sent you a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, the worst thing that you can do is ignore it. A Notice of Federal Tax Lien should be taken very seriously. There are many things that can happen as a result of receiving a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, and if you are not aware of what this letter means for you, how to address it and what the consequences of it may be, you will likely worsen your situation.</p>

					7) Common Small Business IRS Tax Problems?</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<p>The average owner of a small business typically reports a loss in their first year of operation. But when the IRS steps in, many first-timers do not even stand a chance. It is important to stay one step ahead of the game when it comes to obeying Tax Laws. Small Business owners need to make sure they avoid the common problems Small Businesses run into with the IRS.</p>
						<h2>
							Payroll 941 Penalty
						</h2>
						<p>Failing to withhold payroll taxes is the fast track to trouble with the IRS (consequences of not withholding payroll taxes). The penalty for this equals the amount of the taxes that are owed. It is called the 100% Payroll Penalty or “Trust Fund Recovery.” The results of this mishap can be devastating for any Small Business regardless of how successful they are. If you are having issues with payroll taxes, it is possible to resolve these types of taxes, but it may not be easy.</p>
						<h2>
							Classifying Workers
						</h2>
						<p>It is a little tricky, but it is important to properly classify your Small Business workers. The two classifications are “Employees” and “Independent Contractors.” If Employees are misclassified as Independent Contractors, they would avoid Tax Reporting. This is the same as stealing from the IRS, and the punishments imposed for this are not light. Form 22-8 “Determination of Employee Work Status for Purposes of Federal Income Tax Withholding” will help you determine the important differences between an “Employee” and an “Independent Contractor.”</p>
						<h2>
							Overstating Deductions
						</h2>
						<p>Knowing and taking advantage of Tax Credits is important if you want your Small Business to survive and thrive. But you can only deduct the cost of items you use for work. This means no deducting expensive vacations, limo rides, or new editions to your house. The deductions you claim must be reasonable and responsible. Additionally, you have to be ready to prove the deducted items are used for work. If a taxpayer is caught making false deductions, they will owe IRS Tax Debt plus penalties and interest. Do not get greedy when it comes to the IRS.
							<br/>With proper planning and understanding, you can beat the IRS and avoid the Common Problems Small Businesses Encounter. Don’t forget that although there are many issues that come with owning a small business, there are also a few advantages. Do not overlook valuable Tax Credits. Practically everything purchased that goes towards operating your business is Tax Deductible. This means everything from pens and notepads to ovens, delivery trucks, computers, and more.

					8) Consequences of Unpaid Payroll Taxes?</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<p>Being a small business owner is a liberating experience. But with the freedom, comes responsibility. It’s imperative to pay the IRS on time. You must make Business Payroll Taxes a priority. Many are not aware of it, but this can make or break your Small Business. It’s important to know the consequences of being Delinquent on Business Payroll Taxes so you don’t make a deadly mistake with your Business finances.</p>
						<p>When you neglect to pay Business Payroll Taxes on time you will receive a warning from the IRS. If the issue is not resolved in a timely manner, there are several consequences that can become reality:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The IRS imposes a very harsh Penalty when Business Payroll Taxes are not paid. The penalty is 100% of the Taxes owed. This is called “Trust Fund Recovery.” Remember, when your Payroll Tax obligations are not met you are breaking a binding contract you have with the United States Government.</li>
							<li>IRC Section 6672(a) states that the blame for not paying Business Payroll Taxes goes to “every responsible person” who willfully neglected to pay the payroll taxes. This means Accountants, Bookkeepers, and anyone with check signing ability can get the blame for the tax debt.</li>
							<li>Even if there was no bad motive involved, the expensive “Trust Fund Recovery” penalty is imposed. For example, some Business owners fail to pay their Payroll Taxes out of desperation. They may have been trying to save the company from Bankruptcy or protect their employees. But the reasons why you are delinquent are irrelevant; penalties and debt will still be imposed.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>According to the IRS’s official website thousands of taxpayers have outstanding Trust Fund Recovery penalties as a consequence of being delinquent on Business Payroll Taxes. The amount of money is in the billions and it is still growing. You do not want to be another number in this equation. Take care of your IRS Tax issues as soon as possible.

					9) What Is a Tax Levy & What Are The Effects of an IRS Levy?</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<h2>
							What is a Tax Levy?
						</h2>
						<p>A Tax Levy is the IRS’s most lethal weapon it possesses and can be the most financially crippling. This means the IRS will actually seize your assets to satisfy your back tax liability. A tax levy can cause you to lose your checking and savings accounts, investments, IRAs, accounts receivables, inheritances due to be received, social security, pension, insurance policies, or anything else that you own that carries equity.</p>
						<h2>
							Effects of an IRS Levy
						</h2>
						<p>A tax levy will affect you more than any other IRS action. Thirty days after your receive your final intent to levy letter, the process will begin where the IRS will take action on seizing assets. To do this, the IRS sends out notices to any third parties that they believe might be paying you which includes your bank or your employer. These notices say that they must pay the IRS instead of you. When these third parties receive these notices, they will almost 100% of the time honor them because if they don’t, the IRS will hold them personally liable for the amount that they could have collected from you had they honored the notice.</p>
						<h2>
							Types of Tax Levies
						</h2>
						<p>Depending upon your financial and tax situation the IRS will make a determination of which form of levy to use. The most common form of levies are wage garnishment and bank account garnishment but will not rule out physical asset seizure if they don’t feel they can recoup the unpaid taxes through wage or bank account garnishments.
							<br/>
							<br/>Wage Garnishment - Wage garnishment is the most common form of IRS levy. Under this form of levy, the IRS makes an individual employer subtract out a certain amount of money from each pay period to go toward unpaid taxes. Employers just about always follow the requests of the IRS to do this because if they don’t, the IRS will hold the employer liable for the tax amounts that should have been collected through the levy process.
							<br/>
							<br/>Bank Account Levy - With a bank levy, the IRS can access your bank accounts and monitor them and take money from them in order to satisfy tax debts owed. The IRS will continue to seize what money it can until they have collected enough money to cover the total amount of taxes owed.
							<br/>
							<br/>Property Seizure - This is the least common levy method used by the IRS. This is typically the last resort the IRS uses with an uncooperative taxpayer. The IRS can take personal assets such as house, trailer home, boat, cars and just about anything else except for a short list of items they cannot legally take.
							<br/>
							<br/>Social Security Garnishment or Levy - This is a less common tax levy or garnishment method utilized by the IRS compared to other levies. The IRS can garnish up to 15% of Social Security through the Automated Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP), and manually there is no limit on what they can garnish.

					10) What Are The Various IRS Payment Plans Available?</div>
					<div class="faqAccordion__answer">
						<h2>
							Short-term Payment Plan (120 Days or Less)
						</h2>
						<p>If you just need a little extra time to get the money to pay your taxes, you can apply for a short-term payment plan. You can apply for this plan online if you owe less than $100,000 in combined taxes, penalties, and interest.</p>
						<p>There is no setup fee when you agree to pay the full amount within 120 days, but penalties and interest will be added to your balance until the tax debt is paid off.</p>
						<h2>
							Guaranteed Installment Agreement
						</h2>
						<p>The IRS guarantees that it will accept installment agreement requests for taxpayers that meet specific criteria:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You owe $10,000 or less in taxes (not including penalties or interest).</li>
							<li>Your agreement provides for full payment within three years or by the CSED, whichever comes sooner.</li>
							<li>You have been in full tax compliance for the past five years. This also applies to your spouse if you file jointly.</li>
							<li>You aren’t in bankruptcy, and you have not had an IRS payment plan during the past five years.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Setup fees range from $31 for online applications with direct debit installment payments to $225 for applications by phone, mail or in-person with non-direct debit payments. Low-income taxpayers may be able to have these fees waived or reimbursed.</p>
						<h2>
							Verified Financial Installment Agreement
						</h2>
						<p>Some taxpayers need to verify their financial situation when applying for an IRS installment agreement. You will need to complete Form 433-F to disclose your financial information and submit it with your installment agreement request on Form 9465.</p>
						<p>You may need to verify your financials in the following circumstances:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You owe the IRS over $100,000 (IRS generally requires you pay it down below 100k first)</li>
							<li>You owe over $50,000 and aren’t paying by direct debit or payroll deduction</li>
							<li>Your business owes the IRS over $25,000</li>
							<li>The IRS may ask you to liquidate assets if they have value and are liquid to apply those funds to your outstanding tax debt before accepting your installment agreement request.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>
							Partial Payment Installment Agreement
						</h2>
						<p>The IRS grants Partial Payment Installment Agreements (PPIA) in the following circumstances:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The taxpayer has some ability to pay (so they may not be eligible for an Offer in Compromise), and</li>
							<li>Full payment cannot be achieved by the CSED.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>In these cases, the IRS may accept an installment agreement that only pays off a part of your tax debt. You will need to submit detailed financial information before a PPIA will be accepted.</p>
						<p>If you have any assets, the IRS may ask you to liquidate them or borrow against them. If you don’t have equity in the assets, the assets are unmarketable, or liquidation would cause economic hardship, your PPIA may be granted without requiring you to sell or borrow against the assets.</p>
						<p>Once you reach your CSED, the IRS can’t collect payments from you. The IRS may ask you to extend the CSED in exchange for accepting your PPIA. Consult a tax professional if you need help negotiating a PPIA.</p>
